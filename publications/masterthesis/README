the installation instructions below.


Installation on a Unix like system
----------------------------------
A Unix like system is any recent TeX installation on a Unix machine, MacOS X,
or Cygwin on Windows. These TeX installations are all based on teTeX or
TeXLive.

1) Before installing this package, make sure that the memoir package is
   installed on your TeX system. To check this, issue the command
       > kpsewhich memoir.cls
   and make sure it outputs a file path.

2) Find a suitable texmf tree to install in. We'll use $ROOT to refer to
   the root directory of that tree.

   a) For a system-wide installation:
       > ROOT=`kpsewhich -expand-var='$TEXMFLOCAL'`

   b) For an installation for the current user only:
       > ROOT=`kpsewhich -expand-var='$TEXMFHOME'`
      Note: some older installations use HOMETEXMF instead of TEXMFHOME.
      If no directory name is returned, use texmf in your home directory:
       > ROOT="$HOME/texmf"
   
   Make sure this root directory exists:
       > mkdir -p "$ROOT"

3) Unzip kulemt-tds.zip (from <ftp://ftp.esat.kuleuven.be/latex/kulemt/>)
   in $ROOT:
       > unzip -d "$ROOT" kulemt-tds.zip

4) If you also want to install the sources, unzip kulemt-src.zip (from
   <ftp://ftp.esat.kuleuven.be/latex/kulemt/>) in the appropriate
   directory:
       > mkdir -p "$ROOT/source/latex"
       > unzip -d "$ROOT/source/latex" kulemt-src.zip

5) Update the filename database (only needed for system-wide installations):
       > mktexlsr "$ROOT"

Note: All documentation is available in the "$ROOT/doc/latex/kulemt" directory.


Installation on MikTeX
----------------------
This also includes MikTeX derived installations such as proTeXt.

Note: The following procedure has only been tested on MikTeX 2.8.
      The MikTeX options can be accessed through the start menu
      MikTeX 2.8 | Maintenance | Settings. For system-wide installations,
      use "Maintenance (Admin)" instead of "Maintenance".

1) Before installing this package, make sure that you enabled the automatic
   installation of missing packages ("Package installation" on the General
   tab of the MikTeX options)

2) Find a suitable texmf tree to install in. We'll use %ROOT% to refer to
   the root directory of that tree. On the "Roots" tab of the MikTeX
   options, you can select any directory, which is not a MikTeX maintained
   root directory. If you don't find a suitable candidate, create a new
   directory and add it to that tab.

3) Unzip (using 7-zip or winzip or ...) kulemt-tds.zip (from
   <ftp://ftp.esat.kuleuven.be/latex/kulemt/>) into the %ROOT% directory.

4) If you also want to install the sources, unzip kulemt-src.zip (from
   <ftp://ftp.esat.kuleuven.be/latex/kulemt/>) in the directory
   %ROOT%\source\latex .

5) Update the filename database by clicking the "Refresh FNDB" button on
   the General tab of the MikTeX options.

Note: All documentation is available in the %ROOT%\doc\latex\kulemt directory.
