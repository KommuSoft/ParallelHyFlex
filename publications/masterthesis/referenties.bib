	Reasoning by analogy with statistical thermodynamics, we use the

	Basically, the method is an extension of the simulated annealing
	algorithm. At a given temperature, approximations of the variable
	value expectations are computed. This information allows to fix the
	variables as the temperature decreases, so that the size of the problem
	is progressively reduced. It follows a significant improvement compared
	with pure simulated annealing: we obtain better solutions in less
	CPU time. Variable value expectations can be estimated by simulation
	procedures. In the special case of unconstrained 0-1 optimisation
	problems, estimates can be obtained by solving an analytic system.
	Two problems are examined: the travelling salesman problem and the
	minimisation of an unconstrained 0-1 quadratic function.},

  title = {{Solution Concepts in Coevolutionary Algorithms}},
  school = {Computer Science Department, Brandeis University},
  year = {2004},
  address = {USA},
  month = may,
  abstract = {Inspired by the principle of natural selection, coevolutionary algorithms
	are search methods in which processes of mutual adaptation occur
	amongst agents that interact strategically. The outcomes of interaction
	reveal a reward structure that guides evolution towards the discovery
	of increasingly adaptive behaviors. Thus, coevolutionary algorithms
	are often used to search for optimal agent behaviors in domains of
	strategic interaction. Coevolutionary algorithms require little a
	priori knowledge about the domain. We assume the learning task necessitates
	the algorithm to 1) discover agent behaviors, 2) learn the domain's
	reward structure, and 3) approximate an optimal solution. Despite
	the many successes of coevolutionary optimization, the practitioner
	frequently observes a gap between the properties that actually confer
	agent adaptivity and those expected (or desired) to yield adaptivity,
	or optimality. This gap is manifested by a variety of well-known
	pathologies, such as cyclic dynamics, loss of fitness gradient, and
	evolutionary forgetting. This dissertation examines the divergence
	between expectation and actuality in coevolutionary algorithms---why
	selection pressures fail to conform to our beliefs about adaptiveness,
	or why our beliefs are evidently erroneous. When we confront the
	pathologies of coevolutionary algorithms as a collection, we find
	that they are essentially epiphenomena of a single fundamental problem,
	namely a lack of rigor in our solution concepts. A solution concept
	is a formalism with which to describe and understand the incentive
	structures of agents that interact strategically. All coevolutionary
	algorithms implement some solution concept, whether by design or
	by accident, and optimize according to it. Failures to obtain the
	desiderata of {"}complexity{"} or {"}optimality{"} often indicate
	a dissonance between the implemented solution concept and that required
	by our envisaged goal. We make the following contributions: 1) We
	show that solution concepts are the critical link between our expectations
	of coevolution and the outcomes actually delivered by algorithm operation,
	and are therefore crucial to explicating the divergence between the
	two, 2) We provide analytic results that show how solution concepts
	bring our expectations in line with algorithmic reality, and 3) We
	show how solution concepts empower us to construct algorithms that
	operate more in line with our goals.},

	an overview of PVM and a tutorial on setting up and running existing
	programs, and introduces basic programming techniques including putting
	PVM in existing code. There are program examples and details on how
	PVM works on UNIX and multiprocessor systems, along with advanced
	topics (portability, debugging, improving performance) and troubleshooting.
	PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine) is a software package that enables
	the computer user to define a networked heterogeneous collection
	of serial, parallel, and vector computers to function as one large
	computer. It can be used as stand-alone software or as a foundation
	for other heterogeneous network software. PVM may be configured to
	contain various machine architectures, including sequential processors,
	vector processors, and multicomputers, and it can be ported to new
	computer architectures that may emerge.},

	the character of several earlier heuristic proposals and provides
	a variety of new alternatives. The paper also proposes additional
	heuristics that can be used either to supplement the surrogate constraint
	procedures or to provide independent solution strategies. Preliminary
	computational results are reported for applying one of these alternatives
	to a class of nonlinear generalized set covering problems involving
	approximately 100 constraints and 300--500 integer variables. The
	solutions obtained by the tested procedure had objective function
	values twice as good as values obtained by standard approaches (e.g.,
	reducing the best objective function values of other methods from
	85 to 40 on the average. Total solution time for the tested procedure
	ranged from ten to twenty seconds on the CDC 6600.}},

	based on combining funnels and elimination trees. Unfortunately,
	the funnels are linearizable but blocking, and the elimination trees
	are non-blocking but not linearizable. Neither is used in practice
	since they perform well only at exceptionally high loads. The literature
	also describes a simple lock-free linearizable stack algorithm that
	works at low loads but does not scale as the load increases. The
	question of designing a stack algorithm that is non-blocking, linearizable,
	and scales well throughout the concurrency range, has thus remained
	open.This paper presents such a concurrent stack algorithm. It is
	based on the following simple observation: that a single elimination
	array used as a backoff scheme for a simple lock-free stack is lock-free,
	linearizable, and scalable. As our empirical results show, the resulting
	elimination-backoff stack performs as well as the simple stack at
	low loads, and increasingly outperforms all other methods (lock-based
	and non-blocking) as concurrency increases. We believe its simplicity
	and scalability make it a viable practical alternative to existing
	constructions for implementing concurrent stacks.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms have already been more or less successfully
	applied to a wide range of optimisation problems. Typically, they
	are used to evolve a population of complete candidate solutions to
	a given problem, which can be further refined by some problem-specific
	heuristic algorithm. In this paper, we introduce a new framework
	called {\it Iterative Prototype Optimisation with Evolved Improvement
	Steps}. This is a general optimisation framework, where an initial
	prototype solution is being improved iteration by iteration. In each
	iteration, a sequence of actions/operations, which improves the current
	prototype the most, is found by an evolutionary algorithm. The proposed
	algorithm has been tested on problems from two different optimisation
	problem domains - binary string optimisation and the travelling salesman
	problem. Results show that the concept can be used to solve hard
	problems of big size reliably achieving comparably good or better
	results than classical evolutionary algorithms and other selected
	methods.},

  abstract = {{Metaheuristics are the most exciting development in approximate optimization
	techniques of the last two decades. They have had widespread successes
	in attacking a variety of difficult combinatorial optimization problems
	that arise in many practical areas. This bibliography provides a
	classification of a comprehensive list of 1380 references on the
	theory and application of metaheuristics. Metaheuristics include
	but are not limited to constraint logic programming; greedy random
	adaptive search procedures; natural evolutionary computation; neural
	networks; non-monotonic search strategies; space-search methods;
	simulated annealing; tabu search; threshold algorithms and their
	hybrids. References are presented in alphabetical order under a number
	of subheadings.}},
